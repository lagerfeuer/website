My name is **Lukas Deutz**, and I am a **DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer** based in **Atlanta, GA**.
I currently work for [Rooms To Go](https://roomstogo.com).
I specialize in AWS and DevOps technologies, with a passion for automating and optimizing the software development and deployment process.

I have a strong background in AWS, Infrastructure as Code, and Continuous Integration/Delivery.
I have experience designing and maintaining scalable, secure, and highly available systems on AWS.
My skills include: Linux, Terraform, Jenkins, Python, Node.js, and Ruby.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, learning new technologies inside and outside my domain, and various types of sports.
When time permits, I try to give back to the open-source community and I also contribute to the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?K=lagerfeuer&SeB=m).
